# AVR_C_libraries 
These are alternatives for arduino like libraries in atmel studio. It is adviced to understand the code and modify it for your system instead of using them directly so you can learn its theory, how it works.    
Each of these librares has a readme which contains explanation for the code so these help for those who are learning programming in avr microcontrollers.
